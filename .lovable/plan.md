## Update Capability Statement PDF

### What Changes
Replace the existing capability statement PDF (`public/linexo-capability-statement.pdf`) with the newly uploaded version.

### How
1. Copy the uploaded file `user-uploads://LinExo_Capability_Statement.pdf` to `public/linexo-capability-statement.pdf`, overwriting the existing file.

No code changes are needed since the download button already links to `/linexo-capability-statement.pdf`.
