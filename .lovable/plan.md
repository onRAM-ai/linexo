## Update Linen Hire & Delivery Image

### What Changes

Replace the current `src/assets/problem-linen.jpg` image with an AI-generated image depicting a hotel-style share house with multiple rooms -- think neatly made beds, clean linen, and a hospitality/accommodation feel.

### Steps

1. **Generate image** using the AI image generation model with a prompt like: "Professional photo of a clean hotel room interior with neatly made beds and fresh white linen, multiple rooms visible, share house or serviced apartment style, warm lighting, hospitality industry feel"

2. **Save the generated image** as `src/assets/problem-linen.jpg` (overwriting the existing file), so no code changes are needed -- the import in `Index.tsx` already references this file.

### Files Changed
- `src/assets/problem-linen.jpg` -- replaced with new hotel/share house room image (no code changes required)
