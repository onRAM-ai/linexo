## Update "Finish" Step Description

Only one line needs changing in `src/pages/Index.tsx`:

### Change

| Line | Current | Updated |
|------|---------|---------|
| 100 | `"Ironed, folded & pressed"` | `"Quality checked & finished to spec"` |

This replaces the inaccurate "ironed, folded & pressed" with language that still communicates professional finishing and quality without claiming specific processes they don't offer.

No other files or structural changes needed.
