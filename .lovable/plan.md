## Replace client-logo-1.png with New Logo

### What Changes

Replace the existing `src/assets/client-logo-1.png` (blue circle logo) with the uploaded "Lakes Electrical Distributors (LED)" logo.

### Steps

1. Copy `user-uploads://image-29.png` to `src/assets/client-logo-1.png`, overwriting the existing file.

No code changes needed -- the file is already imported and used in the logo carousel.

### Files Changed
- `src/assets/client-logo-1.png` -- replaced with LED logo
