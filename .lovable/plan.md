## Sharpen Pain Points & Solutions (Dan Kennedy Style)

Rewrite the `problemSolutions` array in `src/pages/Index.tsx` (lines 63-88) with shorter, punchier copy. Dan Kennedy's approach: lead with the emotional cost, make it sting, then deliver a clear, specific solution promise.

### Updated Copy

| # | Pain Point (Problem) | Solution Title | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Late linen. Wrinkled sheets. Guests checking in — and you've got nothing ready." | Linen Hire & Delivery | Scheduled pickup and delivery. 24-48hr turnaround. Guest-ready every time. |
| 2 | "Workwear comes back dirty. Or takes a week. Either way, you're exposed." | Industrial Workwear Processing | Commercial-grade cleaning for PPE and overalls. Express turnaround on demand. |
| 3 | "One hygiene complaint could cost you the contract. Are you sure it's actually clean?" | Hygienic Sealed Packaging | Commercially laundered and heat-sealed in packaging. Audit-ready on arrival. |
| 4 | "Bookings surge. Your supplier can't keep up. Rooms sit empty." | Surge & Emergency Processing | Built to scale from 50 to 5,000+ pieces daily. Emergency processing when you need it. |

### Technical Change

- Edit the `problemSolutions` array (lines 63-88) in `src/pages/Index.tsx` with the updated copy above. No structural or component changes needed.
